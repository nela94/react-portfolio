                Hola! üëãüèΩ I'm a proud New Yorker from Queens with strong Honduran and Salvadoran roots. My journey to becoming a software engineer hasn't 
                followed a traditional path. At the age of 18, I landed a job as a receptionist at a Real Estate company, where I was given the opportunity 
                to develop a career as a Real Estate agent. While the job was fun and enjoyable, I never felt truly fulfilled or "challenged enough". I always 
                had an interest in technology and was curious about how I could contribute to the IT department when it came to onboarding agents or fixing network issues.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                Soon, I found myself exploring different careers in the tech industry and stumbled upon a coding bootcamp. I took a few of their pre-work 
                classes and immediately fell in love with the challenge! Five years ago, I made the career change, and I've never looked back. Becoming a 
                software engineer has pushed me in so many ways and has given me a brighter perspective on the world. I now have the ability to build things 
                I never thought possible.
              </p>
